# Machine.Learning.Bootcamp.2019
SHARP (Skills for Health And Research Professionals) Training Program, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University

June 2019.

The Machine Learning Boot Camp was a two-day intensive boot camp of seminars combined with hands-on R sessions to provide an overview of concepts, techniques, and data analysis methods with applications in biomedical research.

Please open 'ML Bootcamp.Rproj' first. This ensures that the R session's working directory is the Machine Learning repo, which allows the use of relative file paths.
